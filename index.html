    <p>Ask questions and share tips for JavaScript,Python, any ecosystem...</p>

      <h3>JavaScript</h3>
        <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.</p>
          <code>console.log( "Hello World! I'm JavaScript!" );</code>

      <h3>Python</h3>
        <p>Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.</p>
          <code>print("Hello, World!")</code>
      
      <h3>Java</h3>
        <p>Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.</p>
          <code>public class HelloWorld {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
      // Prints "Hello, World" to the terminal window.
      System.out.println("Hello, World"); }}</code>
    
      <h3>Dart</h3>
        <p>Dart is a client-optimized programming language for apps on multiple platforms. It is developed by Google and is used to build mobile, desktop, server, and web applications. Dart is an object-oriented, class-based, garbage-collected language with C-style syntax. Dart can compile to either native code or JavaScript.</p>
          <code>void main() => print('Hello, World!');</code>
    
      <h3>Kotlin</h3>
        <p>Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of its standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise.</p>
          <code>fun main() { println("Hello World!") }</code>
